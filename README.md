# Getting and Cleaning Data' Course Project
Repository with the code written for the Getting and Cleaning Data course done through Coursera on June 2015.

*Download and unzip the source data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into your local working directory.

*Put a copy of the run_analysis.R script into the same working directory.

*Execute the script line by line in R or with the command 'source("run_analysis.R")'.

*In order to reload the final tidy data set to R, use the read.table command: 'data <- read.table("final_averages.txt")'.
